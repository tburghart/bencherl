## Environment

`bencherl` is configured through variables that can be set in configuration
files or in the environment before the scripts are run.  Configuration
files (where they're found is discussed below) are sourced by the `bash`
shell and can use (almost) any legal shell capabilities to set up the
necessary variables.

Refer to the [Overview](Overview.md) file for information on how the pieces
work together.
